# Word Game - React Wordle Clone

This project is a recreation of the popular word game, Wordle, using React. The goal of this clone is to provide a similar experience where users can guess a 5-letter word with up to 6 attempts. Feedback is provided per guess, indicating the accuracy of each letter's placement.

## Project Overview

In this Wordle clone, I construct a user interface where players can input their guesses and receive immediate visual feedback. I've modified the input method to be more accessible than the original Wordle, and I've designed the project to be challenging, with structured learning steps through several exercises.

## Local Setup

The project uses Parcel for building and running the local development server. You will need Node.js and NPM installed on your system to run the project.

## Development Journey

### Journey 1: Guess Input

Create a controlled form component in React that allows users to submit guesses. Implement uppercase transformation and input length restrictions.

### Journey 2: Tracking Guesses

Develop functionality to track and display the user's previous guesses without applying game logic.

### Journey 3: Guess Grid

Implement a 5x6 grid display, analogous to the original Wordle game, that dynamically populates with the user's guesses.

### Journey 4: Game Logic

Incorporate game logic by validating guesses against a correct answer and applying appropriate styles to indicate correctness of each guess.

### Journey 5: Game Completion

Handle game-winning and losing scenarios, displaying a banner and disabling input upon completion.

## Stretch Goals (PENDING feature)

For further learning and challenge, stretch goals include implementing a visual keyboard and a restart game feature.
